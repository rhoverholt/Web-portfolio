                <p>Are you ready for a different kind of bio?</p>

                <p>Ivy League degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics launched my IT career back in 1991.  
                    After several years with a small consulting firm based in Princeton, NJ I transitioned into a management role at Norfolk Southern Railroad.
                    My career ran the full cycle of project development: from a twinkle in someone's eye; to a well-defined business case; 
                    to research time on the job developing requirements; to core software design, development, testing; and even into training and implementation
                    and eventual software maintenance.
                </p>

                <p>In 2005 personal tragedy struck and I chose to retire from a wonderful IT career and stay home to raise my son.  
                    At the youthful age of 53, with my son off to college, I am returning to the IT field that I love targeting a more specifically technical role.
                    As I've been out of the field for many years, I have taken a refresher course at GA Tech to gain some specific skills and test my aptitude against some current technologies.
                </p>

                <p>Historically, my strengths have been in collaboration, organization, business analysis, database modeling and querying.
                    My recent classes have focused on Web Development, so I've been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of late.
                </p>
                
                <p>I've included a few sample projects below.  I would enjoy hearing from you at any of the contact methods below.</p>
